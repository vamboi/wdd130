        <p>Hello! My name is Elijah Vamboi. I'm from Freetown, Sierra Leone. I enjoy playing the piano and also playing football.
            I am married with a son. Basically, I am someone who loves his family. I grew up with my siblings in a very humble background
            so we share so much love among ourselves. When the gospel was preached to us in the year 2008, they spoke
            about how our family can be united even after this mortal life. This really caught our attention with so much joy
            to get baptized. Later, we got baptized, and ever since my family and I have been strong in the gospel each day.
            A few years after our baptism, I got the opportunity to go and serve a mission in the Nigeria Lagos Mission.
            After I returned, I started schooling and at the same time working. I later got married, and now I have been called to serve in the ward bishopric.
        </p>
